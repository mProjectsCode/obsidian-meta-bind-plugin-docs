There are two places where you can look for examples.

## Playground

The first place to look for examples is the playground that is build into the plugin.
It can be opened from the plugins settings, or with the `Meta Bind: Open playground` command.
There you will find an interactive list of all input and view fields to play around with.

## Example Vault

The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-meta-bind-plugin) of the plugin contains an example vault.
The example vault is used for testing and is always up-to-date with the **latest development version** of the plugin,
but you will need to install the plugin yourself or build it via the `bun run dev` command, run from the root of the repo.
This means that **not everything in the example vault necessarily works in the current release version of the plugin**.
If you want to view the example vault for a specific release, you can find it by looking at the release on GitHub.
There you will find a link that takes you to the corresponding tag for that release.
From there you can download the example vault for that release.
