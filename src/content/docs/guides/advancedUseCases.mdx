If you are willing to dip your toes into the world of JavaScript, you can do quite a few interesting things with Meta Bind.

:::note
The following examples assume that you have:
1. [JS Engine](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-js-engine-plugin) installed and enabled.
2. Enabled **JS Input Fields** in the Meta Bind settings.

:::caution
I would recommend that you are familiar with JavaScript before attempting to use these examples.
If you are not careful, you can easily create infinite loops or other performance issues.

## Performance Considerations

Dynamically creating input or view fields with JavaScript can have a performance impact, especially if you are doing it all over your notes.

## Dynamic Bind Targets with JavaScript

You can use JavaScript to dynamically change a bind target based on another bind targets value.

This example demonstrates how to use a select input to change the bind target of a number input.
The select input is bound to the `index` variable, and the number input is constructed to be bound to the `list[index]` variable.

````custom_markdown
---
list:
  - 1
  - 2
  - 3
index: 0
---

Index: `INPUT[inlineSelect(option(0), option(1), option(2)):index]`

```meta-bind-js-view
{index} as index
---
const str = `\`INPUT[number:list[${context.bound.index}]]\``;
return engine.markdown.create(str)
```
````

## Dynamic Options for Select Inputs

You can also use JavaScript to dynamically change the options of a select input.

````custom_markdown
---
options:
  - "1"
  - "2"
  - "3"
selected: 1
---

Options: `INPUT[inlineList:options]`

```meta-bind-js-view
{options} as options
---
const options = context.bound.options.map(x => `option(${x})`).join(", ");
const str = `\`INPUT[inlineSelect(${options}):selected]\``;
return engine.markdown.create(str);
```
````
