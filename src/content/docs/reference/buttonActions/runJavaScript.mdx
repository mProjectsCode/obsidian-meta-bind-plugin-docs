The run JavaScript file action runs a JavaScript file.

:::note
This feature requires the that you have the following:

1. [JS Engine](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-js-engine-plugin) installed and enabled.
2. Enabled **JavaScript** in the Meta Bind settings.
   :::

```ts
interface JSButtonAction {
	type: 'js';
	file: string; // the path to the JavaScript file to run, relative to the vault root
	args?: Record<string, unknown>; // optional arguments to pass to the script (available in the script as `context.args`)
}
```

The button configuration is available as a **read only** variable in the script as `context.buttonConfig`.
The args is passed to the script as `context.args`.

### Example

````custom_markdown {5-6}
```meta-bind-button
style: primary
label: Run JavaScript File
action:
  type: js
  file: someScript.js
```
````

With the following `someScript.js` file in the vault root.

```js title="someScript.js"
console.log('Hello World!');
```

You should see the string `Hello World!` printed to the console, when you click the button.
