description: Create Note button action reference.

The _create note_ action creates a new empty note in the specified location.

```ts
interface CreateNoteButtonAction {
	type: 'createNote';
	fileName: string; // the name of the new note
	folderPath?: string; // the folder path where the note should be created, if not specified the note will be created in the root of the vault
	openNote?: boolean; // if true, the note will be opened after creation
	openIfAlreadyExists?: boolean; // whether to open the note if it already exists instead of creating a new one with an incremented name
}
```

When a note with the same name already exists in the specified location, the note will be created with a running number appended to the name.
For example, if a note with the name `Note` already exists, the new note will be named `Note 1`.

### Example

This button will create a new note named `New Note` in the `My Folder` folder.
If a note with the same name already exists, the new note will be named `New Note 1`.
